Final Project

For the final project i am going to build a C++ application that will sort of be like craigslist. It will be similar to the assignment we had at the beginning of the year but I will not building on that code I will be starting from scratch. The application will have different categories electronics, sporting, etc.  You can both post and search to these in categories. Again just imagine a primitive craigslist.
