Final Project

For the final project i am going to build a C++ application that will sort of be like craigslist. It will be similar to the assignment we had at the beginning of the year but I will not building on that code, I will be starting from scratch. The application will have different categories cars, electronics, etc.  You can both post and search to these in categories. The categories will be saved as doubly linked lists for easy adding, printing, and deleting.
